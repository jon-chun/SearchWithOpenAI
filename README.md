# ðŸ¦œðŸ”—ðŸ¤—  Search with LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, Chroma, FAISS, Azure OpenAI and OpenAI

This project will help you learn the basics to -
- Index multiple documents in a repository using HuggingFace embeddings.
- Save the indexes in Chroma &  FAISS for recall.
- Cleanup / delete the indexes to start fresh.
- Query the FAISS and Chroma index / db.
- Search using embeddings (without having to sign up for any OpenAI) for similarity text snippets.
- Search with either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.  You will use the "Which API would you like to use?" page to choose the API to use.
- Bonus: Get details on cost of the call (AI tokens and cost) and also get similar information document search on the store.

# Setup the sample
To use the script, you will need to follow these steps:
- Clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/ushakrishnan/SearchWithOpenAI.git` and `cd SearchWithOpenAI` into the cloned repository.
- Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Copy the .env.template file to .env: `cp .env.template .env`. This is where you will set the following variables.
- Set your OpenAI API key in the OPENAI_API_KEY and Azure OpenAI details in the env file
   
# Run the sample
- Run the script: `streamlit run Home.py`

# What to expect
Streamlit will spin up a page that will look like this

Now go ahead, and ask you questions about the two "State of the Union" speech pdfs and txt you had indexed (some ideas - when were the speeches made? What were the dates that the speeches were made? Summarize both speeches in 100 words or less. What did the president say about affordable care act?)
