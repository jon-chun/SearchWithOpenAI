Welcome! This is a quickstart sample for Azure OpenAI and OpenAI.

>>**Next Steps:**
>>
>>Use the **"Which API would you like to use?" page** to choose the API to explore with.  Once you choose, you will no longer be able to change it,unless you restart the application.
>>
>>If you have not updated the .env file with required keys and values, the **"OpenAI Searches"** section may not work as intended / respond with errors.


This project will help you learn the basics to -
- Index multiple documents in a repository using HuggingFace embeddings.
- Save the indexes in Chroma &  FAISS for recall.
- Cleanup / delete the indexes to start fresh.\
- Query the FAISS and Chroma index / db.
- Search using embeddings (without having to sign up for any OpenAI) for similarity text snippets.
- Search with either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.  You will use the "Which API would you like to use?" page to choose the API to use.
- Bonus: Get details on cost of the call (AI tokens and cost) and also get similar information document search on the store.
